        <p> <b>computers and computing</b>, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and
            software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study
            of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and
            artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from <strong>mathematics and
                engineering</strong> and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory,
            probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of
            hypothesis testing and experimentation during the <em>conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement
                of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.</em></p>

        <h4>First Generation</h4>
        <p>The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the
            basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric
            bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. Therefore, they were very
            expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it.

            In this generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punch cards,paper tape, and magnetic
            tape was used as input and output devices. The computersin this generation used machine code as the
            programming language.</p>

    <div class="firstGen">
        <h4>Second Generation</h4>
        <p>The period of second generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were
            cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation
            machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and
            magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.

            In this generation, assembly language and high-level programming languages likeFORTRAN, COBOL were used. The
            computers used batch processing and multiprogrammingoperating system.</p>

    <div class="firstGen">
        <h4>Third Generation</h4>
        <p>The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits
            (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the
            associated circuitry.

            The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size,reliable, and efficient.
            In this generation remote processing, time-sharing,multiprogramming operating system were used. High-level
            languages (FORTRAN-II TOIV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation.</p>

    <div class="firstGen">
        <h4>Fourth Generation</h4>
        <p>The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale
            Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with
            their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.

            Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, andaffordable. As a result, it gave
            rise to Personal Computer (PC) revolution. In thisgeneration, time sharing, real time networks, distributed
            operating system wereused. All the high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE etc., were used in thisgeneration

    <div class="firstGen">
        <h4>First Generation</h4>
        <p>The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date. In the fifth generation, VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra
            Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million
            electronic components.

            This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (ArtificialIntelligence) software. AI is an
            emerging branch in computer science, whichinterprets the means and method of making computers think like
            human beings. Allthe high-level languages like C and C++, Java, .Net etc., are used in thisgeneration.</p>
